# Conversation History DOX

## Purpose

- Own append-oriented per-channel conversation history, bounded context rendering, discovery, clearing, and point-in-time branching.

## Local Contracts

- Keep each channel/conversation independent, store complete durable JSONL with private permissions, and tolerate only explicitly handled tail corruption.
- `PromptContext` renders one bounded prompt window that always carries the current user entry and the full history path. Prior-history seeding is bounded backward from disk under both message and character limits and is disabled when either limit is non-positive or the provider session already retains the conversation; never load an unbounded history to compute bounded context. A non-positive character limit leaves the current entry complete, while a positive limit bounds it by rune tail with a leading ellipsis or omits an entry whose complete reply identity cannot fit. In seeded mode the current entry is pinned by source identity and degrades to the current-only form when concurrent appends push it outside the bounded tail.
- Branch into a new conversation without mutating its source, retain bounded reply references, and exclude private attachment contents from records.
- Append a recovery baseline to every branch so copied source messages remain context only and can never become stalled-message candidates in the new conversation.
- Retention uses the last durable entry timestamp, falling back to file modification time only for empty histories; delete only strict pre-cutoff regular files and preserve explicitly protected live conversations while reporting per-item failures.
- Recent-authorized proactive routing reads a content-free durable latest-`user` activity sidecar per conversation, ignores assistant, notification, and delivery-ledger entries so delivery cannot select itself, and ignores sidecars without a corresponding history. This sidecar is only the minimal channel-resolution primitive; it carries no reminder policy or state.
- Keep source-message identity, local acceptance time, provider-neutral admission, logical execution, exact terminal/cancellation coverage, retrigger reservation, and local recovery-display facts append-only and private. The recovery activation marker is forward-only: create it without reading or rewriting existing histories, and compare it to local acceptance rather than transport-provided message time so delayed newly admitted messages remain eligible; missing or pre-activation correlation is categorically ineligible. Recovery reads are strict and bounded; classify the complete admitted bound and fail closed on corruption or overflow rather than dispatching from a partial tail. Duplicate-identity checks strictly stream the complete retained history with bounded per-entry memory and fail closed on corruption or unreadable entries; recovery's entry-count limit must never block new messages or framework commands in a long conversation.

- Own committed integration event replay and atomic bounded resynchronization snapshots. Cursors bind workspace/conversation, first history record and exact preceding record; invalid, cleared/replaced, corrupt, missing or excessive-lag cursors fail explicitly. Replay at most 256 raw records/4 MiB per read; snapshots pair the newest 100 visible entries under the existing 2 Mi-rune bound with the same append-lock cursor. A first subscription to an empty conversation appends only a private correlation baseline. Deltas/statuses are not durable subscription events, private ledgers stay hidden, notifications retain their existing outbox identity, and ordinary history retention/clear remains authoritative.
